### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name's Katrina Hill. Welcome to my page :blush:

I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer with a background in environmental compliance, enforcement, and management. Iâ€™m also a Navy veteran with five yearsâ€™ experience as an IT Network Administrator. I'm still passionate about environmental science and want to combine my experience in that field with my new software development career. I feel that the skills I've learned from both careers will allow me to positively contribute to an organizationâ€™s mission and values.
